            <p>
                I'm a passionate web developer with a strong background in both technical and creative aspects of web design and development. Currently enrolled at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies, I am dedicated to pushing the limits of what's possible in the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in coding began with JavaScript during my senior year of high school, and I've since expanded my skills to include Python, HTML, and CSS. I'm always eager to learn and apply new technologies to create innovative solutions that meet the needs of my clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I'm an active member of the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS) and the Syracuse Skate Club (SUSC), where I've held leadership positions that have honed my organizational and communication skills.
