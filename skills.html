            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Python Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Python was the first language I learned at Syracuse University through my CIS 151 course. I immediately fell in love with the language due to my amazing professor and its simplicity. Outside of coding in class, this was the first language I explored for personal projects, including my favorite, the snake game.

            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">HTML/CSS Learning</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently enrolled in a class teaching me to use HTML/CSS, which is helping me refine what I learned during the summer through a brief online course. I really enjoy HTML and CSS since they enable me to explore the creative side of coding. I hope to further my skills by combining my knowledge of JavaScript and HTML/CSS to create websites for local businesses in my area.

        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">JavaScript Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I learned JavaScript as my first coding language through AP Computer Science Principles, which I took during my senior year of high school. This experience convinced me to continue exploring potential careers in coding and led me to the major I am studying today. Creating applications and websites using JavaScript made me realize coding also entails creativity.
